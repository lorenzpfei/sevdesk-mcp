# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Remote transport: a stateless Streamable HTTP endpoint at `POST /mcp`,
  alongside the unchanged stdio entry point. Both are served by the same
  `buildServer(ctx)`, so all 24 tools, all 151 operations, the schemas,
  descriptions, annotations, tool order and the read-only filtering are
  identical across transports — `tests/transport-parity.test.ts` asserts it
  against the real spawned CLI. Built on the SDK's own `createMcpHandler`,
  which serves the current protocol revision and keeps 2025-era Streamable
  HTTP compatibility for clients that need it. No sessions, no `/sse` or
  `/message` route, no Redis. `GET /health` reports status, version,
  transport and counts, and calls sevDesk not at all.
- Provider-neutral authentication around the HTTP handler: `MCP_AUTH_MODE`
  chooses `oauth` (OAuth 2.1 bearer tokens verified as JWTs against the
  issuer's JWKS — signature, issuer, audience, expiry, optional scopes, with
  RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata and a correct `WWW-Authenticate`
  challenge) or `none` for local development. A production deployment must
  set it explicitly; an unset value there makes the endpoint refuse every
  request rather than serve accounting data anonymously. Any other scheme plugs into a
  `verifyToken(request, bearerToken)` hook without touching the sevDesk core.
  Asymmetric algorithms only — an HMAC `alg` against a public JWKS is
  refused.
- `MCP_AUTH_MODE=token`: one shared secret in `MCP_STATIC_TOKEN`, compared in
  constant time (both sides hashed first, so neither length nor a partial
  match leaks through timing), minimum 32 characters. Closes off a
  single-operator remote deployment without standing up an IdP; no identity,
  no expiry, no revocation but rotation, and no use for clients that cannot
  send an `Authorization` header.
- `createToolContext` / `SevdeskCredentialResolver`: each HTTP request builds
  its own context, sevDesk client and VAT-profile resolver, so concurrent
  requests share no token, client or cache. The default resolver reads
  `SEVDESK_API_TOKEN` and nothing else; the MCP access token is never the
  sevDesk API token.
- Vercel deployment example: `vercel.json` plus three small functions in
  `api/`, no framework and no Next.js dependency. A fresh fork deploys with
  documented environment variables and no source changes; the canonical URL
  is `/mcp`. `npm run dev:http` serves the same handler locally.
- Both READMEs document the stdio/HTTP comparison, local HTTP development,
  the Vercel setup, how to hold `SEVDESK_API_TOKEN` server-side, the auth
  modes, client wiring including ChatGPT Developer Mode, and the limits of a
  serverless filesystem for the receipt-folder tools.

- Optional `.env` support for runs outside an MCP client: a `.env` beside
  `package.json` is read at startup, so `npm run dev` and
  `node dist/index.js` no longer need the token pasted onto the command
  line (and into shell history). Read from the package root, never the
  working directory — an npx-launched server inherits the client's cwd,
  and absorbing a stray `.env` from there would be a footgun. Real
  environment variables always win, so a client's `env` block can never be
  shadowed by a stale file. `.env.example` documents every variable.

- Duplicate-write protection: a 5xx or network failure on a write is no
  longer retried — the request may already have reached sevDesk, so a
  replay could create a duplicate draft. A 429 stays retryable for every
  method (a throttled call never executed). `Retry-After` is now clamped
  to 250 ms–30 s (and understood in HTTP-date form), backoff is jittered
  and capped.
- Client-side rate limiter (token bucket, `SEVDESK_RATE_LIMIT`
  requests/second, default 4, `0` disables): bursty audit fan-outs are
  paced instead of colliding with sevDesk's throttle.
- `sevdesk_summarize`: aggregate invoices or vouchers over a period
  without returning rows — counts plus net/tax/gross sums grouped by
  month, status, contact or nothing, bounded output however large the
  ledger (groups beyond `maxGroups` fold into one "(andere)" entry).
- API errors now carry a `kind` (validation / auth / not_found /
  rate_limited / upstream / network) and surface sevDesk's own error
  message instead of a raw JSON dump.
- Tool listing carries standard MCP annotations
  (`readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`/`openWorldHint`) so clients can
  shape their confirmation UX.
- `SEVDESK_DEBUG=true` logs method/path/status to stderr — never query
  strings, bodies or the token.

- Generalized VAT-regime handling: `SEVDESK_VAT_REGIME`
  (`regular` / `kleinunternehmer` / `auto`, default `auto`) replaces the
  Kleinunternehmer boolean. `auto` infers the regime from the newest
  invoices (taxRule 11 / `smallSettlement` / §19 taxText — works on both
  bookkeeping generations); `sevdesk_ping` reports the verdict with
  evidence. `SEVDESK_KLEINUNTERNEHMER` stays honored, marked deprecated.
- Hardened against misconfiguration: an explicit regime that contradicts
  the ledger becomes a `vat_regime_mismatch` audit finding (config still
  wins — loudly). With the regime unknown, `sevdesk_create_invoice`
  refuses to guess a tax rule instead of silently defaulting; audit
  suggestions carry both labeled branches.
- Invoice tax defaults now follow the chosen *rule*, not the regime: 0 %
  rules (Ausfuhr, §4, §13b …) no longer get a silent 19 % default, and
  OSS rules require explicit per-position rates.
- Server `instructions` (MCP-native usage guidance for every client) and
  a shipped Agent Skill (`skills/sevdesk-bookkeeping`) with the
  bookkeeping workflows — monthly close, receipt triage, §13b checks.

- MCP protocol revision 2026-07-28: migrated from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
  1.x to the v2 SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/server` 2.0). Modern clients get
  stateless per-request envelopes and a cacheable tool listing
  (`ttlMs` 1 h, scope private); 2025-era clients are still served through
  the classic initialize handshake — same server instance, negotiated per
  connection by `serveStdio`.
- `server.json`: registry schema pointer bumped 2025-09-29 → 2025-12-11
  (validated; no field changes needed).
- Node.js 20 reached end-of-life (April 2026): minimum engine is now
  Node 22, CI tests on 22 and 24, GitHub Actions bumped to current
  releases (still SHA-pinned).
- Privacy policy (PRIVACY.md), linked from the READMEs and declared in
  the MCPB manifest.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-28

- `sevdesk_invoice_aging`: receivables aging — open invoices bucketed by
  days overdue, partially paid remainders, never-sent drafts.
- Three guarded invoice tools: `sevdesk_create_invoice` (always drafts,
  Kleinunternehmer-aware defaults), `sevdesk_get_invoice_pdf` (never touches
  the send state, never overwrites files), `sevdesk_mark_invoice_sent`
  (non-email send types only, verifies by re-read). Deliberately no
  email-send tool.
- `SEVDESK_KLEINUNTERNEHMER`: audit suggestions and invoice defaults follow
  the §19 rule set.
- Consistency pass across the write layer: every write tool accepts a
  per-call `dryRun` with a uniform `wouldSend` preview; the read-only gate
  moved into the server dispatcher (three enforcement layers now); the
  receipt-dir allowlist has a single implementation.
- Docs: README restructured (English + German), CONTRIBUTING.md, sample
  audit output.
- Distribution: published to npm (`npx sevdesk-mcp`), listed in the official
  MCP registry, MCPB one-click bundle for Claude Desktop attached to
  releases.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-07-28

- README restructured around step-by-step setup instructions (Claude Code,
  Claude Desktop, generic MCP clients) and a documented write-safety model.
- `sevdesk_set_tax_rule` documents its deliberate draft-only scope: the
  sevDesk API refuses updates on booked vouchers, and resetting a paid
  foreign-currency voucher recalculates its EUR amounts at today's exchange
  rate — booked vouchers belong in the sevDesk UI. Found the hard way on
  live data; the tool description now warns about it.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-28

- `sevdesk_receipt_guidance`: query sevDesk's booking-account guidance —
  which DATEV/SKR accounts allow which tax rules and rates.
- `sevdesk_audit_vat` now checks positions against that guidance
  (`account_rule_mismatch`) and prefers the supplier contact's registered
  country over the name-suffix heuristic when judging reverse-charge
  candidates; a German contact downgrades the finding (§19 suppliers).
- `sevdesk_set_tax_rule`: guarded rebooking of a voucher onto a different
  VAT rule — refuses enshrined vouchers and wrong-side rules, supports
  `dryRun`, verifies the result by reading the voucher back.
- `sevdesk_reconcile_transactions`: match bank transactions against vouchers
  by amount and date proximity; reports missing receipts and unpaid vouchers.
- Tax rules 16 and 22 ("nicht steuerbar"), which the live ReceiptGuidance
  exposes but the spec tables omit.
- Hardening: receipt file tools now refuse to run without an explicit
  `SEVDESK_RECEIPT_DIRS` allowlist (previously unrestricted); GitHub Actions
  pinned to commit SHAs; dependencies upgraded to clear all `npm audit`
  findings (runtime and dev); `SECURITY.md` documents the threat model.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-28

- Full sevdesk-Update 2.0 tax-rule model: revenue and expense rule sets,
  side detection via `creditDebit`, side-mismatch and not-usable-on-vouchers
  findings. Corrects `noteu` → rule 17 (not 5) and rule 3 (not reverse charge).
- `sevdesk_reverse_charge_report` splits §13b amounts by meaning:
  deductible (12/14), non-deductible (13), own revenue (5).
- `sevdesk_ping` reports the account's bookkeeping system version.
- Voucher dates no longer shift a day through timezone conversion.
- Failed position fetches surface as warnings instead of being swallowed.
- Server assembly factored out of the stdio entry point (`src/server.ts`).
- Validated against a live sevDesk account (bookkeeping system 2.0).

## 0.1.0

- Initial skeleton: 16 tools, generated 151-operation catalogue, safety flags
  (`SEVDESK_READ_ONLY`, `SEVDESK_DRY_RUN`, `SEVDESK_RECEIPT_DIRS`).
