# sevdesk-mcp

**English** · [Deutsch](README.de.md)

**The complete MCP server for [sevDesk](https://sevdesk.de): every API endpoint, guarded writes, and a built-in bookkeeping audit layer.**

Connect Claude (or any MCP client) to your sevDesk account: list and create vouchers and invoices, reconcile bank transactions, reach all 151 API operations — and run audits that know what a *wrong* booking looks like: a foreign supplier booked as domestic 0 % instead of Reverse Charge §13b, a tax rule the booking account doesn't allow, a payment with no receipt behind it.

> **Status: v0.4.0.** Live-validated against a real sevDesk account (bookkeeping system 2.0) — where the audit found exactly the class of mis-booking it was built for. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick start

**You need:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ≥ 22, a sevDesk account, and an MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or any other).

**1. Get your API token**

In sevDesk: **Settings → Users → your user → API**. The token is a 32-character hex string.

> ⚠️ A sevDesk API token has **no scopes** — it can do everything your login can. Treat it like your password, and start in read-only mode.

**2. Connect your MCP client**

*Claude Code* — one command, then put your real token into the config it writes (`~/.claude.json`):

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user sevdesk \
  --env SEVDESK_API_TOKEN=REPLACE_ME \
  --env SEVDESK_READ_ONLY=true \
  -- npx -y sevdesk-mcp
```

*Claude Desktop* — add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (**Settings → Developer → Edit Config**):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sevdesk": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "sevdesk-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SEVDESK_API_TOKEN": "your-token",
        "SEVDESK_READ_ONLY": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Any other MCP client works the same way: stdio transport, `npx -y sevdesk-mcp` (or `node dist/index.js` from a clone), config via environment variables. To run from source instead: `git clone https://github.com/joosthel/sevdesk-mcp && cd sevdesk-mcp && npm install && npm run build`.

**3. First run**

Restart your client and ask it to run `sevdesk_ping`. You should see `ok: true`, your bookkeeping system version (2.0 = `taxRule`, 1.0 = legacy `taxType`) and the mode (`READ-ONLY`). Then start asking:

- *"Run a VAT audit for this year and explain every high-severity finding."*
- *"Are my US software subscriptions booked as reverse charge? What's my §13b base this quarter?"*
- *"Which bank payments have no receipt yet?"*
- *"Draft an invoice for contact 1009: 3 days of consulting at 800 €."* (needs write mode)
- *"Which booking accounts allow taxRule 12?"*
- *"Call the sevDesk API: get the last 10 orders."* — the generic catalogue covers everything the curated tools don't.

**What a finding looks like:**

```json
{
  "severity": "high",
  "code": "zero_rate_booked_as_domestic",
  "voucher": "2026-06-24 · Acme Cloud, Inc. · 88.03 EUR · #INV-2043",
  "detail": "Booked as \"Vorsteuerabziehbare Aufwendungen\" (taxRule 9) but every position carries 0 % VAT, and the supplier's contact is registered in \"us\".",
  "suggestion": "If this is a service from a supplier established abroad, it is Reverse Charge: taxRule 12 (§13b Abs. 2, with input-tax deduction) …"
}
```

**4. Enabling writes (optional, later)**

Once you trust the setup, set `SEVDESK_READ_ONLY` to `"false"` and restart the client. Every write tool accepts `dryRun` (and honors the global `SEVDESK_DRY_RUN`) — it shows exactly what would be sent without sending it. See [Write safety](#write-safety).

## Tools

**24 tools cover all 151 API operations.**

### Audit

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sevdesk_audit_vat` | Flags reverse-charge mis-bookings, rules from the wrong side of the books, tax rules the booking account doesn't allow, rates that contradict the tax rule, sums that don't add up, suppliers booked inconsistently. Uses the supplier contact's country where available |
| `sevdesk_reverse_charge_report` | Totals the §13b tax base for a period — split into nets-to-zero (rule 12/14), actually payable (rule 13) and own revenue (rule 5) |
| `sevdesk_find_duplicates` | Repeated document numbers, same supplier + amount within N days, vouchers stuck in Entwurf |
| `sevdesk_subscription_gaps` | Detects monthly cadences per supplier and reports the missing months |
| `sevdesk_diff_receipt_folder` | Diffs a local folder of receipt PDFs against booked vouchers, both directions (requires `SEVDESK_RECEIPT_DIRS`) |
| `sevdesk_reconcile_transactions` | Matches bank transactions against vouchers by amount and date proximity: payments without a receipt, vouchers without a payment |
| `sevdesk_invoice_aging` | Who owes you money and for how long: open invoices bucketed by days overdue, partially paid remainders, drafts never sent |

### Everyday

`sevdesk_ping` · `sevdesk_summarize` · `sevdesk_list_vouchers` · `sevdesk_get_voucher` · `sevdesk_list_invoices` · `sevdesk_list_contacts` · `sevdesk_list_transactions` · `sevdesk_receipt_guidance` · `sevdesk_upload_voucher_file` · `sevdesk_create_voucher` · `sevdesk_set_tax_rule` · `sevdesk_create_invoice` · `sevdesk_get_invoice_pdf` · `sevdesk_mark_invoice_sent`

Highlights: `sevdesk_summarize` aggregates invoices or vouchers server-side — counts and net/tax/gross sums grouped by month, status or contact — so questions like "revenue in Q2" or "expenses by supplier" cost a few hundred tokens however large the ledger is. `sevdesk_receipt_guidance` answers "which booking account / tax rule / rate combinations does sevDesk actually accept" from sevDesk's own validation table. `sevdesk_set_tax_rule` rebooks a draft voucher onto a different VAT rule with guardrails. `sevdesk_create_invoice` always creates **drafts** — nothing reaches a customer without review. `sevdesk_get_invoice_pdf` saves the rendered PDF without touching the invoice's send state.

### Full coverage

`sevdesk_list_operations` · `sevdesk_describe_operation` · `sevdesk_call`

Rather than registering 151 tools and swamping the client's tool list, the server ships a searchable catalogue generated from sevDesk's OpenAPI document. Search for what you need, read its signature, call it. Every endpoint is reachable.

## Common workflows

The tools compose — these are everyday bookkeeping jobs, each a single prompt:

- **Month-end close:** *"Do a month-end check for June: pending drafts, bank payments without receipts, vouchers without payments, VAT findings, sums that don't add up."*
- **Chasing money:** *"Who owes me money? Show overdue invoices by age, and tell me which ones were never even marked as sent."*
- **Receipt discipline:** *"Compare my receipts folder with sevDesk and list what's missing on either side."* (needs `SEVDESK_RECEIPT_DIRS`)
- **Recurring costs:** *"Which subscriptions stopped appearing, and which suppliers am I booking inconsistently?"*
- **Before the VAT return:** *"Run the VAT audit and the §13b report for the quarter and summarize what my Steuerberater should know."*
- **Anything else:** *"Call the sevDesk API: …"* — orders, credit notes, exports, parts and every other endpoint are reachable through the catalogue.

### Agent Skill (optional)

The package ships an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) with these
workflows spelled out — monthly close order, receipt triage, §13b
investigation, audit-finding interpretation — so agents load the
know-how on demand instead of rediscovering it each session. For Claude
Code, copy it next to your project:

```bash
cp -r node_modules/sevdesk-mcp/skills/sevdesk-bookkeeping .claude/skills/
```

(or copy from a clone of this repo). Clients without skill support lose
nothing: the server's own `instructions` and tool descriptions carry the
essentials.

## Remote deployment (Streamable HTTP)

The same server also runs as a remote MCP endpoint over stateless Streamable
HTTP — for clients that connect to a URL instead of spawning a process
(ChatGPT Developer Mode, hosted Claude connectors, your own agents).

| | Local stdio | Remote Streamable HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| Start | `npx -y sevdesk-mcp` (client spawns it) | `POST https://<your-deployment>/mcp` |
| Where the token lives | your MCP client's `env` block | a server-side environment variable |
| Who can reach it | only you, on your machine | anyone who passes authentication |
| Authentication | none needed — it is a local process | OAuth 2.1 bearer tokens (or explicitly none) |
| Session state | one process per connection | none; every request is self-contained |
| Receipt file tools | your filesystem | only with a mounted, readable directory |
| Tools | all 24 | the same 24, in the same order |

Both transports are served by the same `buildServer(ctx)`, so the tool names,
schemas, descriptions, annotations and read-only filtering are identical by
construction — and a test asserts it against the real spawned CLI.

### Local HTTP development

```bash
npm run dev:http                    # http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
```

Reads the same `.env` as `npm run dev`. Auth defaults to `none` locally, so
MCP Inspector can connect to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp` straight away. Start
with `SEVDESK_READ_ONLY=true`.

### Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjoosthel%2Fsevdesk-mcp)

Or import the repository manually: **Add New → Project → Import** your fork,
leave the framework preset on *Other*, and add the environment variables
below before the first deploy. `vercel.json` handles the rest — it builds the
package and routes `/mcp`, `/health` and the OAuth metadata paths onto three
small functions in `api/`. No source changes are needed.

Node.js: `engines.node` is `>=22`, which is what Vercel selects the runtime
from. Pin **22.x** or **24.x** in *Settings → Build and Deployment → Node.js
Version* if you want it fixed.

**Setting the sevDesk token safely.** Add `SEVDESK_API_TOKEN` as an
*Environment Variable* in *Settings → Environment Variables* (Vercel encrypts
it at rest and it is only readable by the function at runtime). Never put it
in `vercel.json`, in a client config, or in the URL. The server sends it to
sevDesk and nowhere else: it never appears in a tool result, a log line, an
error message, `/health`, or any OAuth metadata document. A sevDesk token has
no scopes, so scope the risk instead — deploy with `SEVDESK_READ_ONLY=true`
first.

**Environment variables** (names only — set the values in Vercel):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SEVDESK_API_TOKEN` | yes | the sevDesk token, server-side only |
| `MCP_AUTH_MODE` | yes in production | `oauth` or `none` — there is no default in production |
| `MCP_OAUTH_ISSUER` | with `oauth` | issuer URL of your authorization server |
| `MCP_OAUTH_AUDIENCE` | with `oauth` | audience your IdP issues tokens for, normally your `/mcp` URL |
| `MCP_OAUTH_JWKS_URI` | no | JWKS endpoint; discovered from the issuer when unset |
| `MCP_OAUTH_SCOPES` | no | scopes every token must carry |
| `MCP_PUBLIC_URL` | on a custom domain | your canonical `/mcp` URL; also the Host/Origin allowlist |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | no | extra hostnames accepted in `Host` |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | no | hostnames accepted in `Origin` |
| `SEVDESK_VAT_REGIME` | recommended | set it explicitly so no request has to infer the regime from the ledger |

Every `SEVDESK_*` variable from [Configuration](#configuration) works here
too, with the same defaults — the remote transport sets no hidden ones of its
own.

### Authentication

Public source code is not the same thing as a public endpoint. Anyone can
read this repository; nobody should be able to read *your* books. A
deployment therefore has to say what it wants:

- **`MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth`** — every request needs a valid OAuth 2.1 bearer
  token. Tokens are verified as JWTs against your authorization server's
  JWKS: signature (asymmetric algorithms only), issuer, audience, expiry, and
  scopes when configured. The server advertises
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728) and answers an
  unauthenticated request with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge pointing there,
  so a client can discover the authorization server on its own. Any
  standards-compliant IdP works — Auth0, Descope, WorkOS, Keycloak, your own.
- **`MCP_AUTH_MODE=none`** — no authentication. For local development and
  tests. In a production deployment it must be set *explicitly*; with
  `MCP_AUTH_MODE` unset there, the endpoint refuses every request and says
  why, rather than quietly serving your accounting data to the internet.

This server is only ever a Resource Server: it verifies tokens and never
issues them, and there is no password login to add. For anything the two
modes do not cover — token introspection, an IdP SDK, a static development
token — pass a `verifyToken(request, bearerToken)` hook to
`createSevdeskHttpHandler`; the sevDesk core does not change. The MCP access
token is never the sevDesk API token. Which sevDesk account a request reaches
is decided by a `SevdeskCredentialResolver`, whose default simply reads
`SEVDESK_API_TOKEN`.

### Connecting a client

The MCP URL is the full HTTPS URL of `/mcp`:
`https://<your-deployment>/mcp`.

**ChatGPT Developer Mode** — in *Settings → Connectors*, add a connector with
that URL and choose OAuth authentication, then complete your IdP's consent
flow. This needs `MCP_AUTH_MODE=oauth`; a static bearer token is not
something every ChatGPT surface lets you configure, so do not plan around
one.

**MCP Inspector** — `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`, transport
*Streamable HTTP*, URL `https://<your-deployment>/mcp`.

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http sevdesk https://<your-deployment>/mcp
```

**Any other Streamable HTTP client** — point it at the same URL; it is a
plain `POST` endpoint speaking current Streamable HTTP, with 2025-era
compatibility for clients that have not moved yet. There is no `/sse` or
`/message` route, no session store and no Redis.

### Limits of a serverless deployment

- `sevdesk_diff_receipt_folder`, `sevdesk_get_invoice_pdf` and
  `sevdesk_upload_voucher_file` need a real, readable directory named in
  `SEVDESK_RECEIPT_DIRS`. A serverless filesystem is ephemeral and holds none
  of your receipts, so on Vercel these tools stay listed and return the same
  clear error they return locally when no directory is configured. Use stdio
  for folder work, or mount storage the function can read.
- Every request builds its own server instance, so nothing is cached between
  calls. With `SEVDESK_VAT_REGIME=auto`, that means one extra invoice lookup
  whenever a tool needs the regime — set the regime explicitly on a remote
  deployment.
- Vercel caps a request body at 4.5 MB and a function's runtime at its plan's
  maximum duration; a very large audit is better run over stdio.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SEVDESK_API_TOKEN` | *(required)* | Your sevDesk API token |
| `SEVDESK_READ_ONLY` | `false` | Hide write tools; `sevdesk_call` stays listed but refuses mutating operations at call time |
| `SEVDESK_DRY_RUN` | `false` | Show what a write *would* send, without sending it |
| `SEVDESK_VAT_REGIME` | `auto` | `regular`, `kleinunternehmer` (§19 UStG) or `auto`. `auto` infers the regime from your recent invoices; `sevdesk_ping` reports what was detected and why. Tax-rule defaults and audit suggestions follow the regime. An explicit value that contradicts the ledger is reported as an audit finding, never silently trusted |
| `SEVDESK_KLEINUNTERNEHMER` | `false` | Deprecated — use `SEVDESK_VAT_REGIME=kleinunternehmer`. Still honored when `SEVDESK_VAT_REGIME` is unset |
| `SEVDESK_RECEIPT_DIRS` | *(unset — file tools disabled)* | Colon-separated allowlist of directories the receipt file tools may read and write |
| `SEVDESK_BASE_URL` | `https://my.sevdesk.de/api/v1` | Override the API host |
| `SEVDESK_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | Per-request timeout |
| `SEVDESK_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Retries with jittered backoff and a clamped `Retry-After`. A 429 is always retried (the throttled call never ran); a 5xx or network failure is retried **only for reads** — a write is never replayed on an ambiguous failure, so a timeout cannot create a duplicate draft |
| `SEVDESK_RATE_LIMIT` | `4` | Client-side pacing in requests/second (token bucket), so bursty audit fan-outs don't collide with sevDesk's throttle. `0` disables pacing |
| `SEVDESK_DEBUG` | `false` | Log `METHOD /path -> status` to stderr — never query strings, bodies or the token |

The remote transport adds `MCP_AUTH_MODE`, `MCP_OAUTH_*`, `MCP_PUBLIC_URL`,
`MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — see
[Remote deployment](#remote-deployment-streamable-http). They are unused over stdio.

Set these in the `env` block of your MCP client — that is the supported path and the
one the client controls. For runs outside a client (`npm run dev`, `node dist/index.js`
from a clone), copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the package root and the server reads it
at startup. The file is read from the package root, never the working directory, and
real environment variables always win over it, so a client's `env` block can never be
shadowed by a stale `.env`. `.env` is gitignored.

The threat model, guarantees and vulnerability reporting are documented in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Privacy Policy

Everything runs locally: your token and accounting data flow only between your MCP client and the sevDesk API — no storage, no telemetry, no third parties. Full policy: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Write safety

Read-only mode is enforced three times: write tools are hidden from the tool list, the dispatcher refuses them, and the HTTP client refuses every mutating request independently. With writes enabled:

- Every write tool accepts a per-call `dryRun` and honors the global `SEVDESK_DRY_RUN`.
- `sevdesk_create_voucher` and `sevdesk_create_invoice` default to **drafts** — nothing is booked or sent silently.
- `sevdesk_set_tax_rule` and `sevdesk_mark_invoice_sent` refuse enshrined documents and verify their changes by reading the document back.
- There is deliberately **no email-send tool**, and `sevdesk_get_invoice_pdf` never overwrites an existing file.
- **Booked and paid vouchers are deliberately out of scope for API rebooking.** The sevDesk API only updates drafts, and resetting a paid foreign-currency voucher recalculates its EUR amounts at today's exchange rate — silently changing historical values. Correct booked vouchers in the sevDesk UI, where the original amounts stay visible against the receipt.

## The tax model

With sevdesk-Update 2.0, sevDesk models VAT through `taxRule` — split into a revenue set and an expense set. Older documents still carry the deprecated `taxType` string; the server understands both generations.

**Expense rules** (incoming vouchers, `creditDebit: "C"`):

| taxRule | Meaning | Rates | Legacy `taxType` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `8` | Innergemeinschaftliche Erwerbe | 0 / 7 / 19 % | — |
| `9` | Vorsteuerabziehbare Aufwendungen | 0 / 7 / 19 % | `default` |
| `10` | Nicht vorsteuerabziehbare Aufwendungen | 0 % | `ss` |
| `12` | **Reverse Charge §13b Abs. 2, mit Vorsteuerabzug** | 0 % | — |
| `13` | **Reverse Charge §13b, ohne Vorsteuerabzug** | 0 % | — |
| `14` | **Reverse Charge §13b Abs. 1, EU** | 0 % | — |
| `16` | Nicht steuerbar (Ausgabe) | 0 % | — |

**Revenue rules** (outgoing documents, `creditDebit: "D"`):

| taxRule | Meaning | Rates | Legacy `taxType` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `1` | Umsatzsteuerpflichtige Umsätze | 0 / 7 / 19 % | `default` |
| `2` | Ausfuhren | 0 % | — |
| `3` | Innergemeinschaftliche Lieferungen | 0 / 7 / 19 % | `eu` |
| `4` | Steuerfreie Umsätze §4 UStG | 0 % | — |
| `5` | **Reverse Charge §13b (Feld 60)** | 0 % | — |
| `11` | Steuer nicht erhoben nach §19 UStG | 0 % | `ss` |
| `17` | Nicht im Inland steuerbare Leistung | 0 % | `noteu` |
| `22` | Nicht steuerbar (Einnahme) | 0 % | — |

(Rules 18–21 — One Stop Shop and §18b — exist on invoices but are not accepted on vouchers; the audit flags them if they appear anyway.)

The classic mis-booking: a subscription from a supplier established abroad, booked as a plain domestic expense (`taxRule 9`) with a 0 % position. It looks harmless — reverse charge nets to zero for anyone with input-tax deduction — but it silently drops the §13b tax base out of your VAT return. The correct booking is `taxRule 12` (or 13/14, depending on your situation). A CSV export cannot show you the difference, because it only carries the *rate*, not the *rule*. `sevdesk_audit_vat` finds it.
